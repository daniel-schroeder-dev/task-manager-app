# Task Manager App

A simple task management app.

## Project Goals

This project is meant to showcase some skills I've learned over the past 6 months while taking courses on NodeJS development. The back-end will use Node/Express/MongoDB, and the front-end will use JS/CSS/HTML, with no frameworks. 

There will be four sections to the app:

1. Splash page that shows features of the app
2. Simple user signup/login page
3. Task manangement dashboard
4. User profile page

The task management dashboard will allow the user to:

1. Create tasks
